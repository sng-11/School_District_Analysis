# School District Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
The purpose of this project is to create a high-level snapshot of the district's school system to better inform discussions and decision-making for the State Board of Education. School performance trends are extracted from the source data using the Pandas library, in the Jupyter Notebook interface. For example, the education board would like to know how budget per student, school size, and type of school may influence the performance of students. In addition, the code written for this project takes into account the academic dishonety discovered in Thomas High School's 9th-graders. This report aims to investigate how this academic misconduct will affect the high-level school district analysis.

## Key Metrics of Interest to the School Board

- Total number of students
- Total number of schools
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage of students who passed math
- Percentage of students who passed reading
- Overall passing percentage
